<p>This game was designed by me for a 
fund-raising event that I organised to raise money for the
<a href="http://apostleshipofthesea.org.uk/">Apostleship of the Sea</a> when I was 10. Originally, <a href="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/">Nicola L. C. Talbot</a> wrote the actual code, and I just did the storyboard and images. However, I remade the game myself using JavaScript years later.<br>
If you enjoy playing the game, please consider <a href="http://apostleshipofthesea.org.uk/cms/donate-to-us">making a donation to the AOS</a>.<br></p>

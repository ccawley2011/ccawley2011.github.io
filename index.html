<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>This includes both ports of applications from other platforms, as well as some original tools. Most of the software listed here is for <a href="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/">RISC OS</a>, although some things may work with other operating systems.</p>

<tr><td id="scummvm"><img src="images/scummvm_icon_1024.png" width="34" alt=""></td><td><h3 class="progname">ScummVM</h3> <p class="version">Latest version: 2.5.1</p>
ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!  <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=RISC_OS">More info</a></td>

<h2 id="aos"><a href="https://apostleshipofthesea.org.uk">Apostleship of the Sea</a></h2>
<p>Back in 2007, I followed some advice in a magazine and created a 'Joke Machine'. After creating it, I decided to use it to raise money for a charity called the Apostleship of the Sea, who looks after seafarers.<br>
In the years following, I decided to create computer based joke machines, which can be viewed below.<br>
It really shows its age, but I've left it here for reference.</p>
